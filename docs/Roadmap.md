# 🗺️ Bliss Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development of **Bliss**, a privacy-first dating platform built on Aleo.  
Each wave is designed to deliver **real user value**, **measurable ecosystem impact**, and **progressive decentralization**.

We intentionally ship in waves to balance:
- user onboarding
- technical risk
- privacy guarantees
- long-term sustainability

---

## 🚀 Wave 1 — Foundation (Completed)

**Goal:** Prove that zero-knowledge verification can power a real consumer social app.

### What’s Delivered
- ✅ Zero-knowledge age verification smart contract (`age_verification.aleo`)
- ✅ Leo Wallet integration (Aleo Testnet)
- ✅ Private verification records (no age stored or revealed)
- ✅ User onboarding flow (wallet → verify → profile)
- ✅ Privacy-focused landing page
- ✅ Deployed contract on Aleo Testnet
- ✅ End-to-end demo usable by non-crypto users

### Why This Matters
- Demonstrates Aleo’s suitability for **consumer-facing apps**
- Onboards Web2 users without exposing private data
- Establishes a reusable ZK verification pattern for social platforms

---

## 🔐 Wave 2 — Private Interactions (In Progress)

**Goal:** Enable safe, privacy-preserving user interaction beyond onboarding.

### Planned Features
- 🔒 Encrypted peer-to-peer messaging
- 🧩 Privacy-preserving matching logic
- 🧾 Additional ZK credentials:
  - Age range (not exact age)
  - Location proximity (without revealing exact location)
  - Education / employment proofs (opt-in)
- 🎛️ Fine-grained selective disclosure controls
- 📱 Improved mobile responsiveness

### Technical Focus
- Expanding ZK proof composition
- UX patterns for privacy controls
- Minimizing metadata leakage

### Outcome
Users can **interact meaningfully** while keeping sensitive information private by default.

## 🌐 Wave 3 — Decentralization & Scale (Planned)

**Goal:** Reduce off-chain dependencies and scale Bliss as a decentralized protocol.

### Planned Features
- ⛓️ Fully on-chain or decentralized profile storage
- 🗂️ Migration from centralized databases where feasible
- 🧠 Advanced matching using ZK-compatible logic (ZK-ML exploration)
- 🪙 Token-assisted features (non-extractive, utility-focused)
- 🏛️ DAO-based governance for protocol decisions
- 📲 Native mobile apps (iOS & Android)

### Technical Focus
- Scalability on Aleo
- Long-term data availability
- Governance without compromising privacy

---

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision (Research & Exploration)

**Goal:** Push the boundaries of what privacy-first social applications can be.

### Exploratory Ideas
- 🌍 Cross-application identity & credentials
- ⭐ Privacy-preserving reputation systems
- 🎥 Zero-knowledge assisted video verification
- 🧠 AI-assisted matching with cryptographic guarantees
- 🎟️ Event-based social coordination
- 🌱 Open protocol adoption by other apps

These features are research-heavy and will only be pursued if they maintain Bliss’s core privacy guarantees.

## 📊 Milestone Summary

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|-----|------|-------|
| Wave 1 | ZK verification & onboarding | ✅ Complete |
| Wave 2 | Private interactions | 🚧 In Progress |
| Wave 3 | Decentralization & scale | 🧭 Planned |
| Vision | Protocol & ecosystem growth | 🔮 Research |

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

- **Privacy is non-negotiable**
- **Users own their data**
- **Zero-knowledge over trust**
- **Decentralize progressively, not recklessly**
- **UX matters as much as cryptography**

---
