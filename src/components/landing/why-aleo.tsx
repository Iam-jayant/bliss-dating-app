            Bliss is built on Aleo, a new kind of blockchain designed for privacy from the ground up. Unlike other platforms where data is public by default, Aleo uses zero-knowledge cryptography to allow applications to run entirely off-chain, ensuring user data remains private and user-controlled. This makes it possible to verify facts without revealing your identity, creating a foundation for truly private social discovery.
